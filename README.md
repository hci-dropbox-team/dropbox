##HCI Drop Box App
---

To build, it's best to have Linux Subsystem for Windows installed. 



This website was made with Bootstrap and Jekyll. The colors, icons, and theming were gotten from the Tabler template. 



Required libraries:

+ Ruby2.3, or Ruby2.5 depending on your system.
  + The gems Jekyll and Bundler are required to get manually. Using the build files you can get the rest of the dependencies automatically.
+ Node.js and NPM

The full instructions are over at https://github.com/tabler/tabler. The same instructions can be followed for this project; we started out using tabler, tore everything out of it except for the dependency system (and we got our own Google Maps API key for this project).
